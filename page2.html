            <p>This is the first project I did at Moringa School which was all about learning the basics of HTML. I came a long way from making a simple "Hello World" page to a very fine tuned portfolio page.</p>

            <p>On my way to becoming a good software developer, Moringa school outlined a 5week prep course which was to prepare us for more enhanced coding later on. In this project, I worked on learning the basics of HTML and styling with CSS</p>

            <p>Every Software Developer needs a place for storing and keeping track of their projects. Git is one type of control version that allows a user to update and keep track of their codes. Github on the other hand is the "Final destination on which the developer can store and showcase their code to the outised world.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My Name is Jackson Lucas and I'm a young teenager interested and always excited about the digital world. I studied in Star Sheikh Primary School, where I completed in the year 2013 leaving the school with a KCPE "A" graded certificate. I was then enrolled to Sunshine Secondary School where I developed interest in computer studies and was always curious on how things work behind the human eye. I graduated from "SSS" with a B+ in the year 2017. After completing my high school, I also realised God gifted me with a football talent that had been in the shadowsm for somewhile. Ever since, I have trained and played with teams such as Naivas FC, Greenpark FC and Sofapaka in Kenya and Future Lions in China. I decided to join Moringa School in order to hon my skills as a software developer and learn more about coding and programming. This has always been a subject of interest for me. My current hobbies are Football,Gaming and Reading.</p>
