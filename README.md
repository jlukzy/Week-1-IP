# Week-1-IP
This is the Week 1 Independent Project Assignment on creating a personal portfolio
Coded by Jackson Lucas
This project displays a portfolio page I have coded using HTML and separate stylesheets for each .html file. Inclusive within the file are also images used as my background on the 2webpages
The project instructions were to incorporate use of HTML tags, a separate stylesheet that uses CSS, correct indentation and spacing, regular commits, a readme and finally deploying the project to github.
